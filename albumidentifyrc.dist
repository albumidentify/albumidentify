[renamealbum]

# Default naming scheme for renamed files. Please see 
# "renamealbum --scheme-help" for an up to date list of options
# The default naming scheme will produce something similar to the following:
# Lavigne, Avril - 2007 - The Best Damn Thing/01 - Avril Lavigne - Girlfriend
#naming_scheme=%(sortalbumartist)s - %(year)i - %(album)s/%(tracknumber)02i - %(trackartist)s - %(trackname)s

# Default destination location for renamed albums. If nothing is specified
# the current working directory will be used
#dest_path=

# By default renamealbum will put soundtracks in a folder called soundtracks
# in the destination directory. Enabling this option stops this feature.
#leave_soundtrack_artist=False

# When set to True tracks must be found in order. Otherwise tracks can be found
# in alternate orders but may produce false positives of similar albums
#force_order=True

# When this option is set to true renamealbum will ensure that only 1 album is
# written to a directory. This prevents double ups of flac and mp3 albums in 
# the same folders.
#no_dest=False

# Controls what filetypes renamealbum acts upon, provided as a comma separated 
# list of extensions. Currently only mp3, ogg and flac are supported.
#limit_extensions=.mp3,.ogg,.flac

[albumidentify]

# Submit PUIDs for newly identified tracks
#push_shortcut_puids=False

# Location of the genpuid program which generates puids when the audio track
# fails to return a puid
#genpuid_command=

# This key enables genpuid to work. At this point no-one knows where to get
# one. Politics seems to be preventing people from being able to generate
# new keys. Join the channel #albumidentify on Undernet if you have a lot
# of tracks you have no puids for.
#musicdnskey=

# Limit the time renamealbum spends trying to rename a single album. If this is
# set to a number greater than 0 then albumidentify will try renaming each 
# album for the specified number of seconds. Otherwise it will try until 
# exhausting all possibilities
#timelimit=0
